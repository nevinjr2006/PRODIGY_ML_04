🚀 Gesture-Based AI: Hand Gesture Recognition Using CNN 🤖🖐️
Hand Gesture Recognition System that enables intuitive human-computer interaction using just a camera and AI.

🔍 What I Built: Using the LeapGestRecog dataset, I trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify 10 different hand gestures with high accuracy. This system can be integrated into gesture-based control interfaces for gaming, accessibility tools, robotics, and more.

🛠️ Tech Stack:
Python 🐍
TensorFlow / Keras
OpenCV
Scikit-learn
Data: 20,000+ grayscale images from Leap Motion Controller

📈 Model Highlights:

Preprocessing: Grayscale conversion, resizing, normalization
CNN with dropout to prevent overfitting
Achieved strong accuracy on validation/test data
Future-ready for real-time gesture recognition with webcam

💡 Next Steps:

Integrating real-time webcam input for live gesture control
Converting to TensorFlow Lite for mobile/embedded use
